          <p class="panel">The new crown pneumonia virus is still spreading around the world. There have been confirmed cases in 188 countries around the world, the total number of confirmed cases has exceeded 6 million, and nearly 400,000 people have died as a result.</p>
          <p class="panel">On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic a global pandemic. The WHO usually makes this decision when an infectious disease can easily spread from person to person in multiple places around the world.
            The WHO warned that we are still far from the end of the new crown epidemic, and there may be new rapid outbreaks, especially in areas where the closure policy is lifted. People should be prepared for this.
            Since many people with mild symptoms are not tested and included in the statistics, the actual number of cases is expected to be much higher than the reported data.</p>
          <p class="panel">Agence France-Presse estimates that at least 4.5 billion people in the world currently live under the social distancing policy, which accounts for half of the global population.
            These policies have had a serious impact on the global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the world may face its worst economic recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
            The United Nations World Food Program also warned that the pandemic may nearly double the number of people suffering from extreme hunger.</p>
